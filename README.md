# nba_api_shiny

This project aims to visualize NBA player's shot chart data onto a 3D-rendered basketball court to better understand the shot selection for any given player. The data was gathered using the NBA Stats package found within R, extracting over 33,000+ play-by-play data from the most recent NBA season. Even though the code was written during the 2023-2024 season, it was written in a way that extracts the most recent NBA season's stats.
With these visualizations, we can assess player tendencies such as whether a player is primarily in the post or has adopted a more modern style of play that has evolved beyond the arc. Some interesting shot charts may include Stephen Curry for his electric and high-volume 3-point shooting, Demar Derozen for a mid-range centric athlete, or even Victor Wenbanyama
for his unprecedented blend of skills for his towering height of 7'3". 

The main objective of this project was to explore what R has to offer and the process of making an R Shiny application. This project was a feat of exploration, curiosity, and a desire to create a project about something that I'm interested in and implement tools that I want to use to further my learning. Additionally, I was able to find that this project can be hosted for free and can be viewed by clicking the link below.

# Considerations for Future Features

Since it was my first time using some of the packages such as Plotly and Shiny, there are some ideas that weren't able to be translated in the timeline I gave myself for this project. Additionally, it was initially meant to visualize the '23-'24 season. Below are some considerations/additions that I would make if I were to come back to this project one day:

- [ ] One of my initial desires was to have an on hover effect for each shot data, particularly changing its color and potentially drawing an arc from that point to the basket
- [ ] There is possible extension to visualize all of the years available in the NBA Stats API via a year filter
- [ ] Consider another version of the graph that is more of a heatmap to identify shot percentages per zone
- [ ] Consider another tab that will allow side-by-side comparison of two player's shot charts
- [ ] Find a way to restrict the camera to not be able to see below court

# Conclusion

Overall, this was a project that I enjoyed making because of my joy for basketball and visualizations. As a Bay Area native and avid-watcher during the 2010s, it always felt magical seeing Steph Curry or Klay Thompson have these 3 point barrages and seeing them break countless 3 point records over the years. That same awe is transposed onto their shot charts because of the sheer volume and makes from their preferred shot zones which is beyond the arc, evidenced by the sheer density observed around it. Even in NBA 2K, the shot chart harbors a sense of importance and impression since it's essential for winning games, earning badges, or defining your hot spots for your created player. I feel that juxtaposing NBA 2K with real-life basketball characterizes what these players are doing, defining their comfort spots and the playstyle that attributes to their personal skillset. 

I previously made a scoreboard version using Python, Angular, and PostgreSQL but it lacked this kind of visual that would've made it feel more complete. So I feel that this complemented that project fairly well and does a great job at fulfilling the intended purpose. 

Lastly, this project gave me perspective on planning and patience when it comes to learning something new and applying it. It may be evident that the code isn't inherently the cleanest code I have ever written but it's the first time using these technologies and for the sake of functionality-**IT WORKS!** 
I would love to make another project utilizing R and even R Shiny because of its easy deployment and **free** hosting on their website. Furthermore, I would love to learn to apply my learning/capability in the industry to gain experience and establish my value as a contributor to a project.

Thank you for exploring my project and I hope you enjoyed exploring the different shot charts! If you would like to discuss potential opportunities with me, feel free to message my Linkedin below :>
