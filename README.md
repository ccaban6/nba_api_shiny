# nba_api_shiny

This project aims to visualize NBA player's shot chart data onto a 3D-rendered basketball court to better understand the shot selection for any given player. The data was gathered using the NBA Stats package found within R, extracting over 33,000+ play-by-play data from the most recent NBA season. Even though the code was written during the 2023-2024 season, it was written in a way that extracts the most recent NBA season's stats.
With these visualizations, we can assess player tendencies such as whether a player is primarily in the post or has adopted a more modern style of play that has evolved beyond the arc. Some interesting shot charts may include Stephen Curry for his electric and high-volume 3-point shooting, Demar Derozen for a mid-range centric athlete, or even Victor Wenbanyama
for his unprecedented blend of skills for his towering height of 7'3". 

The main objective of this project was to explore what R has to offer and the process of making an R Shiny application. This project was a feat of exploration, curiosity, and a desire to create a project about something that I'm interested in and implement tools that I want to use to further my learning. Additionally, I was able to find that this project can be hosted for free and can be viewed by clicking the link below.
